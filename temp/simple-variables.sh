Vim has a humongous amount of commands. In time, when you become an experienced Vim user, the commands will become second nature, reflexive and automatic. At the beginning though, you'll need to learn them one by one.

A great way to learn Vim commands is by using mnemonics like associating a letter to a word that is easier to remember. For instance, you can remember that w lets you move from word to word by associating it with word, or that b lets you move word to word backwards by associating it with back.
